# HoPo2 (Homopolymer Experiment Rev 2)

Add the following components to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes ***_on_*** ice.

Table A	Amount	Final Concentration
dNTP	10 uL	100mM
oligonucleotide	Alan	
5X TdT Reaction buffer	10 uL	5X
autoclaved, distilled water		(total volume to 50uL)

Table B	Function	1	2	3	4 (Incubation Time)
A	Just Primers (No TdT)	20min	40min	60min	80min
B	Primers+50% Extra dNTPs+TdT	20min	40min	60min	80min
C	Primers+dNTPs+50% Extra TdT	20min	40min	60min	80min
D	Primers+dNTPs+TdT	20min	40min	60min	80min
E	Primers+50% Extra dNTPs+50% Extra TdT	20min	40min	60min	80min
F	50% Primers+dNTPs+TdT	20min	40min	60min	80min
G	50% Primers+50% Extra dNTPs+50% Extra TdT	20min	40min	60min	80min
H	200% Primers+dNTPs+TdT	20min	40min	60min	80min
I	200% Primers+50% Extra dNTPs+50% Extra TdT	20min	40min	60min	80min


1. Add 1 µl TdT (15 units/µl). Mix by gentle pipetting. (Still on ice)
2. Incubate at 37ºC for given time, see above, table B.
3. Stop the reaction by bringing the solution to 95ºC for 20 minutes. 
4. Then, bring to 20ºC for 1 min for handling
5. Prepare Agarose (Use Cobalt Chloride as a buffer for Gel)
    1. To volume 80mL of H2O and Buffer, add 1.2g Agarose
        2. Heat in increments in microwave until fully dissolved
	    3. Let cool until heat is *not* unbearable to the touch
	        4. Pour into gel casting tray
		    5. Place well template (comb) in correct slot
		        6. Let cool
			6. Pre-stain Samples with Cybr Green
			7. Run Gel @135V for 20 minutes. (D was run for 40min)
			8. Analyze Gel on Gel Viewer
			9. Record (Pictures, notes)

			## Alan Amount

			An Alan amount is defined as follows:

			> Heads up - https://www.neb.com/protocols/1/01/01/a-typical-dna-tailing-reaction lists that you want 5pmols of DNA. That means you roughly should dilute 100x, and then add 5 microliters of that intermediate dilution. Math on this:

			> The tube has 29.6 nanomoles of DNA suspended in 296 microliters of DNA. In each microliter, there is .1 nanomole of DNA. .1 nanomoles is 100 picomoles. Ergo, you want a twentieth of that. - Alan Tomusiak
