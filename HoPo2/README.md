# Results:

Results from HoPo2 were inconclusive most likely due to a buffer concentration problem and/or due to a large excess of DNA. HoPo2 hopes to fix these issues by using the correct concentration of buffer and decreasing the concentration of DNA. However in retrospect, it appears that too little DNA might have been used for viewing accurately on a gel reader. Because of this the samples that we managed to collect were inconclusive as we could not see the DNA on gels to verify if TdT preformed it's tailing operation. We are moderately sure that this is not due to issues with TdT because the primer is obscured as well. (Note: there is contamination in the primer well of the 20min sample which is clearly visible.) However after rerunning some of the samples during HoPo3 , it became clear that the samples from HoPo2 might have been run off of the gel into the gel electrophoresis buffer due to a small procedural mistake. As such HoPo2 is inconclusive and not particularly useful to our overall goal.
