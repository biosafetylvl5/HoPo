# HoPo4 (Homopolymer Experiment Rev 4)

Add the following components to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes ***_on_*** ice. Form three groups, one for dATP, dTTP and dCTP (dGTP is excluded due to lack of reagents)

| Table A                     | Amount                 | Notes                                                                                    |
|-----------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| dNTP                        | 1 uL                   |                                                                                          |
| oligonucleotide             | See procedure          |                                                                                          |
| 5X TdT Reaction buffer      | 10 uL                  | 5X                                                                                       |
| autoclaved, distilled water | (total volume to 52uL) | (For dTTP, part 2, final volume should be 26uL. Make sure to to half all other reagents) |

| Table B | Function                       |
|---------|--------------------------------|
| A*2     | 1nmol Just Primer (No TdT)     |
| B*2     | .0125nmol Primer               |
| C*2     | .0625nmol Primer               |
| D*2     | .125nmol Primer (Truely 2.5uM) |


1. Add 2 µl TdT (15 units/µl). Mix by gentle pipetting. (Still on ice)
2. Incubate at 35ºC for 60min
3. Stop the reaction by bringing the solution to 95ºC for 10 minutes. 
4. Then, bring to 20ºC for 1 min for handling
5. Prepare Agarose (Use Cobalt Chloride as a buffer for Gel)
    a. To volume 80mL of H2O and Buffer, add 2.4g Agarose
    b. Heat in increments in microwave until fully dissolved
    c. Let cool until heat is *not* unbearable to the touch
    d. Pour into gel casting tray
    e. Place well template (comb) in correct slot
    f. Let cool
6. Pre-stain Samples with Cybr Green (add 8uL to agarose solution)
7. Run Gel @100V for 20 minutes
8. View
9. Analyze Gel on Gel Viewer
10. Record (Pictures, notes)
11. Repeat steps 7-10 until sample is clearly visible (or all hope is lost)
