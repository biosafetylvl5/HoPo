# Results:

HoPo4 hoped to (1) verify the positive results from [HoPo3](./../HoPo3), (2) determine if differing nucleotides (dTTP, dCTP) could be added and (3) if so, how does their addition differ from that observed with dATP in HoPo3? In order, the results are:
1. HoPo3 does not appear to be a fluke. HoPo4 displayed very similar signs of nucleotide addition
2. Different nucleotides seem to be appended sufficiently
3. dCTP seems to be added at a lower rate, as predicted from readings. Moreover, dTTP seems to mirror dATP in its addition characteristics. It seems likely that dGTP will be similar in addition characteristics to dCTP, but a future experiment will likely be preformed to confirm this fact.
