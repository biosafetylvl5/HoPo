# Results:

HoPo4 hoped to (1) verify the positive results from [HoPo3](./../HoPo3), (2) determine if differing nucleotides (dTTP, dCTP ...) could be added and (3) if so, how does their addition differ from that observed with dATP in HoPo3? In order, the results are:
1. HoPo3 does not appear to be a fluke. HoPo4 displayed very similar signs of nucleotide addition
2. Different nucleotides seem to be appended sufficiently
3. dCTP and dGTP seem to be added at a lower rate, as predicted from readings. Moreover, dTTP seems to mirror dATP in its addition characteristics.
