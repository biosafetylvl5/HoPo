# HoPo1 (Homopolymer Experiment Rev 1)

Add the following components to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes on ice.

Table A	Amount	Stock Concentration
dNTP	10 uL	100mM
Ooligonucleotide	0.25 to 2.0 nmol	5 to 40 nmol/mL
TdT Reaction buffer	2 uL	5X
Autoclaved, distilled water	To a total volume to 50uL	

Table B	Function	1	2	3	4
A	Just Primers (No TdT)	20min	N/A	N/A	80min
B	Just Primers (No TdT)	20min	N/A	N/A	80min
C	Test 1 (Primers, TdT)	20min	40min	60min	80min
D	Test 2 (Primers, TdT)	20min	40min	60min	80min


1. Add 1 µl TdT (15 units/µl). Mix by gentle pipetting. (Still on ice)
2. Incubate at 37ºC for given time, see above, table B.
3. Stop the reaction by bringing the solution to 95ºC for 20 minutes.
4. Then, bring to 20ºC for 1 min for handling
5. Prepare Agarose (Use Cobalt Chloride as a buffer for Gel)
    1. To volume 50mL of H2O and Buffer, add 1.5g Agarose
    2. Heat in increments in microwave until fully dissolved
    3. Pour into gel casting tray
    4. Place well template (comb) in correct slot
    5. Let cool

6. Run Gel @135V for 20 minutes  (Additionally, D was run for 40 minutes)
7. Post stain with CYBR Green
8. Analyze Gel on Gel Viewer
9. Record (Pictures, notes)
