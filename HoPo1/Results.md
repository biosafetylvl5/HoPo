# Results from HoPo 1:

No difference between the "tailed" samples and the control primer was observed in any of the gels that we ran. This indicates that (in all probability) TdT did not tail our DNA.

There are a few reasons that this could have happened. They are as follows:

  1. Not enough buffer: We accidently added the wrong amount of TdT buffer to the samples. Without buffer, TdT did not have the correct pH or correct concentration divalent metallic ions probably causing TdT to not catalyze the addition of nucleotides to the primer.
  2. In spite of the buffer issue, TdT may have added minimal nucleotides to the primer, but due to the large amount of primer that we used (**CHECK:** 2nmol) is possible that we simply did not see the additions due to the untailed DNA being present in an overwhelming majority.
  3. Contamination/Human error are always possible explanations, but do not seem very likely in this situation.
