# Homopolymer Expiriment (aka **HoPo**)

**TL;DR:**
We used TdT (Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase) to add dNTPs to the 3' end of oligonucleotides.

## Summary

HoPo is the first step in a series of experiments that will facilitate the synthesis of DNA without a template in space. We are using TdT or Terminal Deoxynucleotidyl Transferase to add nucleotides to an existing oligonucleotide as a proof of concept to demonstrate that we can add nucleotides to a strand of DNA. We are doing this because we believe that this is the simplest step that we can pursue in relation to TdT catalyzing reactions with DNA. Below are the protocols for the initial attempts at HoPo and the results with reflections upon the results from those protocols.

## Chemistry of TdT

TDT or terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase capitalized and the addition of deoxynucleotidyl triphosphate to already existing oligonucleotide  of length three base pairs or longer. TDT does so with the help of a divalent cation in the appropriate buffer solution At 37°C.  TDT denatures at about 95°C, so we are abusing this fact  by bringing our solution  to 98°C to stop any nucleotide addition.
