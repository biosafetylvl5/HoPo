HoPo3 displayed promising results for the tailing of oligonucleotides with TdT. There seems to be a clear increase in primer length for samples incubated with TdT versus samples not incubated with TdT. Moreover samples with less DNA seem to have a larger increase in length when compared to other samples incubated with more, providing further support to our hypothesis. In short, HoPo3 by all accounts seems to be a success. Mainly, HoPo4 will confirm HoPo3's findings and expand on a few small aspects not explored in HoPo3 such as the dNTP concentration and/or incubation time.
