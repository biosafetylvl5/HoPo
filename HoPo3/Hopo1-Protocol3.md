# HoPo3 (Homopolymer Experiment Rev 3)

Add the following components to 1.5-ml microcentrifuge tubes ***_on_*** ice.

Table A	Amount	Final Concentration
dNTP	1 uL	
oligonucleotide	See procedure	
5X TdT Reaction buffer	10 uL	5X
autoclaved, distilled water	(total volume to 50uL)	

Table B	Function
Ax2	1nmol Just Primer (No TdT)
Bx2	.0125nmol Primer
Cx2	.0625nmol Primer
Dx2	.125nmol Primer (Truely 2.5uM)


1. Add 2 µl TdT (15 units/µl). Mix by gentle pipetting. (Still on ice)
2. Incubate at 35ºC for 60min
3. Stop the reaction by bringing the solution to 95ºC for 10 minutes. 
4. Then, bring to 20ºC for 1 min for handling
5. Prepare Agarose (Use Cobalt Chloride as a buffer for Gel)
    1. To volume 80mL of H2O and Buffer, add 2.4g Agarose
        2. Heat in increments in microwave until fully dissolved
	    3. Let cool until heat is *not* unbearable to the touch
	        4. Pour into gel casting tray
		    5. Place well template (comb) in correct slot
		        6. Let cool
			6. Pre-stain Samples with Cybr Green
			7. Run Gel @100V for 20 minutes
			8. View
			9. Analyze Gel on Gel Viewer
			10. Record (Pictures, notes)
			11. Repeat steps 7-10 until sample is clearly visible (or all hope is lost)
